Project Overview: 
    This project focuses on developing data analysis techniques to detect motor faults by analyzing back
    EMF (Electromotive Force) data collected after motor assembly. Using both time-domain and 
    frequency-domain analysis, the project aims to identify variations in motor performance caused by 
    design parameter changes such as magnet Br values, eccentricity, rotor/stator misalignment, 
    skewness, and bearing jam or fault during the assembly/manufacturing process related to these design 
    parameters. The ultimate goal is to use algorithmic and machine learning approaches to classify motor 
    conditions based on the back-EMF data. 


Project Objectives: 
    1. Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Signal Analysis: Apply signal processing 
       techniques to analyze the data and extract critical features like amplitude, phase angle, FFT, 
       and harmonics. 
    2. Algorithm Development for Fault Classification: Develop a machine learning based 
       algorithm to classify motor conditions and identify the specific faults.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop advanced data analysis techniques to detect motor faults by analyzing back EMF (Electromotive Force) data collected post-assembly. Through both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis, the objective is to identify performance variations caused by key design and manufacturing parameters, such as:

- Changes in magnet Br values
- Eccentricity
- Rotor/stator misalignment
- Skewness
- Bearing faults or jams

By detecting anomalies linked to these factors, the project seeks to apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to classify motor conditions based on back-EMF data, providing insights into potential assembly or manufacturing faults.

## Project Objectives
1. **Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Signal Analysis**: Apply signal processing techniques to analyze motor data, focusing on extracting key features such as amplitude, phase angle, Fourier Transform (FFT) data, and harmonic patterns.
2. **Algorithm Development for Fault Classification**: Use machine learning algorithms to classify motor conditions, distinguishing normal conditions from specific fault types identified through the data.

## Config File Setup

To simplify file management, a `config.ini` file is included to centralize paths to all data files. Users must update these paths in `config.ini` to reflect their local directory structure before running the code.

1. **Reference Data Paths**: Within the `[data_paths]` section, specify paths for the `ideal_data` and `non_ideal_data` variables. These should be the primary Excel files containing data on ideal and non-ideal machine behaviors, respectively.
2. **Harmonic Data Paths**: If harmonics data files were created from the initial datasets, specify these paths under `ideal_harmonics_data` and `non_ideal_harmonics_data`. These files contain frequency-domain data and harmonics calculated from the initial ideal and non-ideal datasets.

Example configuration for `config.ini`:

```ini
[data_paths]
ideal_data = /path/to/your/ideal_data.xlsx
non_ideal_data = /path/to/your/non_ideal_data.xlsx
ideal_harmonics_data = /path/to/your/ideal_harmonics_data.xlsx
non_ideal_harmonics_data = /path/to/your/non_ideal_harmonics_data.xlsx
```

Replace `/path/to/your/...` with the absolute paths on your system. This setup ensures that paths only need to be adjusted in the config file, simplifying the code and setup process.
